# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework

## Background Context

In this project, We will improve our previous iteration of [AirBnB Clone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74) using Flask Python web framework.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to learn:

- What is a Web Framework
- How to build a web framework with Flask
- How to define routes in Flask
- What is a route
- How to handle variables in a route
- What is a template
- How to create a HTML response in Flask by using a template
- How to create a dynamic template (loops, conditions…)
- How to display in HTML data from a MySQL database

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
